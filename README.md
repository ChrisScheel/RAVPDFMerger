# RAVPDFMerger
The [RAV (Regionale Arbeitsvermittlung)](https://wira.was-luzern.ch/ueber-uns/organisation/rav-luzern/) in Luzern wants every job application related document so they can check if the search efforts were real and sufficient. 
To make my life easier i wrote this simple console application where the user can input a path to a directory and after that it will merge all PDFs into one.

The program uses the Aspose.PDF API.
